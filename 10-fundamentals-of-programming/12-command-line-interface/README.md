# Command line
> The command line interface is a reliable and powerfull set of tools for the developer. It is often the fastest and best way to interract with the system, files and programs. 

## Learning goals
At the end of this topic you should: 
* understand what the command line interface is
* know some basics command
* be more familiar with the terminal 
* be more familiar with the Linux system and file structure
 
## Lectures / Prerequisite to this topic 
> No particular reading or homework for this session. A GNU/Linux system with a terminal is required.  

The development environement must be installed and ready to use, as explained in the [dev-environment](https://github.com/WeIgniteTech/dev-environment/blob/master/README.md) _how-to_ guide.  

## Content of the session
> The session is approx. 1 hour. We present the commands under and then use them in these [exercises](https://github.com/WeIgniteTech/command-line). 

  * shortcuts: `ctrl+c`, `ctrl+l`, `ctrl+k`, `ctrl+a` and `ctrl+e`
  * structure of a command (name, option, output, _man pages_, ...)
  * navigation: `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`
  * folders & files manipulation: `mkdir`,  `touch` og `rm`(!), `less`, `cat`, `more`
  * `vi` and `vim` (if we have time)


## Homework
> Finish the [exercises](https://github.com/WeIgniteTech/command-line) started in this session. Use the terminal rather than the graphical interface for file manipulation

Other exercises
  * [Learn the command line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) (in the browser) 
  * Type some of the commands you learned in the tutorial above in the `terminal` of your VM
  * Try the _man page_ (manual) for some commands, f.ex. `man ls`
