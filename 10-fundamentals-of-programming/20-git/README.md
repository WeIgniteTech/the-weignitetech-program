# Git and GitHub
<!-- Short introduction describing this topic -->
> When we develop software, we create files, add lines of code to the files, remove lines of code from the files, delete files, rename files, rename files... we make changes.
We do this in collaboration with others. Version control system is a tool that helps us track these changes that we introduce to our code.
Git is a distributed version control system. GitHub is a collaboration website that hosts Git repositories.


<!-- why it is relevant for the student(context), what will the student practically learn form this topic. What we can expect. -->

Some of the benefits of Git and GitHub are
* Having access to your code from any computer
* Having full overview of the changes you make to your code
* Ability to collaborate with others
* Ability to contribute to open source projects
* It's widely used VCS in most work places
* It can be used as part of your CV, where you can show case what you have worked on

## Content
<!-- 
> The content section covers all the needed material to make the topic understood buy the student. It should contain some practical *exercices* that will be done on-site, as well as _further explanation_ or a demo. 

> *Important*: Give some idea of the duration and amount of work.

The content can be written directly here in this `README.md` file or [in another file or sub-folder](https://github.com/WeIgniteTech/the-weignitetech-program/a-topic/a-sub-topic-section/page-does-not-exist-yet)

A content section should contain one of these: 
* On-site exercise(s)
* Demo
* Presentation
* Discution
-->

[This link](https://backlog.com/git-tutorial/) has a very good introduction of git for beginners. <!-- [Reference to the powerpoint presentation]() -->

## Homework
<!-- 
> Homework will make students master the topic 
-->
* create a folder with a file
* make it a git repository
* push it to your github account
